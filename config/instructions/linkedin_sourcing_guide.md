LinkedIn Sourcing Guide for Technical Recruiters

1. Start With the JD

Before searching, carefully review the Job Description.

Your first task is to break the JD into:

A. Core Technologies (Must-Have Skills)
These are fundamental skills that require real experience and cannot be learned in 1-2 weeks.
Examples:

- Main backend language (Python, Go, Java, etc.)
- Core framework (Django, Spring, Node.js, etc.)

If a candidate does not have real experience in these, they are likely not a fit.

B. Secondary / Nice-to-Have Skills
These are skills that can be learned relatively quickly or are supportive:

- Specific tools (Docker, Terraform, CI tools)
- Minor frameworks
- Monitoring tools
- Internal libraries
- Architecture experience (microservices, distributed systems)
- Cloud platform experience (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Database type (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)

Do not reject strong candidates because they are missing secondary skills.

2. Build the Search Query

When sourcing on LinkedIn, focus on:

Location
Use the target geography specified in the JD.
If remote, confirm timezone compatibility.

Title
Use variations of:

- Senior Backend Engineer
- Backend Developer
- Software Engineer
- Senior Software Engineer
- Platform Engineer (if relevant)

Avoid being too narrow with titles.

Core Technology Keywords
Include the main backend language and framework in the search.

Example:
"Senior Backend Engineer" AND Python AND AWS

3. Evaluate Experience Properly

Once you open a profile:

A. Years of Experience
Check employment history.
Look at:

- Total backend experience
- Time spent in relevant roles
- Stability (short contracts vs long-term roles)

Do not rely only on "X years experience" listed in summary.

B. Relevance of Previous Companies
Strong signal if candidate worked at:

- Tech companies
- Product companies
- High-scale environments
- Startups with real engineering culture

Be cautious with candidates who:

- Mostly worked in unrelated roles
- Have unclear job descriptions
- Jump roles every few months without explanation

4. Assess Technical Depth

Look for:

- Clear description of backend responsibilities
- Mention of architecture ownership
- Experience designing APIs
- Experience scaling systems
- Performance optimization experience

Profiles that only say "worked on backend" without detail are weaker signals.

5. Additional Positive Signals

These increase candidate quality:

- Skills section aligned with JD
- Endorsements for core technologies
- Recommendations from colleagues
- Open-source contributions
- Technical posts or activity
- Leadership or mentoring experience
- Conference talks or community involvement

These are not mandatory but strong pluses.

6. Red Flags

- Only course-based experience
- No clear backend ownership
- Buzzword-heavy profile without real examples
- No progression in responsibility
- Tech stack mismatch with core requirements

7. Final Qualification Check

Before outreach, confirm:

- Core tech stack matches
- Years of relevant backend experience are sufficient
- Location/timezone fits
- Seniority matches role
- Profile shows real backend work, not just maintenance

If 70-80% of core requirements match and candidate looks strong, reach out.

Perfect 100% matches are rare. Strong fundamentals matter more than tool alignment.
